# Matrix-Calculator
A matrix calculator capable of performing operations such as Matrix Addition, Matrix Subtraction, Matrix Multiplication, Matrix Inversion, and Determinant Computation. Interface created using HTML5 + CSS3, with JavaScript being utilized for computational work and input management.

This project was created alongside two close friends of mine: Arnold Gozum and Ali Hussain. My primary job was to utilize JavaScript in order to hold and manage user inputs, dynamically generate interfaces based off of said input, and retrieve such data to use in the computational work. Additionally, I also assisted in helping the general design of the website using HTML5 and CSS3.
